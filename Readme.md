# Factorio Infested Mod Plan

OK, so as a massive fan of star craft, warhammer 40k and all things sci-fi, and knowing that I loved the idea of the krastorio guys adding in creep and bilogical elements to factorio, I thought it would be a fun idea to try and create a mod that adds in a full biological layer to factorio, and so the idea for Factorio Infested was born.
I am still fleshing out the details, but I thought I would share the basic concept so far.
I would absolutely love to hear any feedback you all have, and I would also love to see what you all would like to see in the mod.
If anyone is interested in helping out, please let me know.
To really make something of this, I will need a lot of help, and I would love to have a team of people helping me out, especially with graphics and sprites.

## Core Concept
The Factorio Infested mod is a full overhaul of the game. Players take on the role of an infected engineer, gradually transforming their factory from standard mechanical structures into a fully biological network as they spread creep, capture biters for genetic data, and evolve their technology, eventually spreading their tendrils across the galaxy (or at least near by planets.... for now)

## Gameplay Loop

1. **Gather Resources**: Initially use standard mining and tree harvesting to collect raw materials
2. **Process Biomass**: Convert raw materials and organic matter (trees, biters) into biomass through dissolution pools
3. **Infuse Resources**: Combine traditional resources with biomass to create specialized hive materials
4. **Expand Creep Network**: As biomass accumulates, creep spreads, enabling more advanced structures
5. **Capture Biters**: Extract genetic data from biters to fuel evolution and unlock new abilities
6. **Upgrade Structures**: Gradually transform mechanical buildings into biological versions with enhanced functionality
7. **Evolve for Space**: Reach the late game by growing massive biological structures capable of space travel

## Key Mechanics

### Infected Engineer Progression
- Initially human but visibly infected, gaining biological enhancements over time
- Starts with standard Factorio buildings that show signs of infestation
- Eventually transforms into a Hive Overlord with enhanced abilities:
  - Slower movement speed than the standard engineer
  - Better mining capabilities (using tentacles)
  - Natural resistance to certain damage types
  - Can see further (higher vision range)
  - Larger inventory (biological storage sacs)

### Resource Integration
- Traditional Factorio resources are infused with biomass to create specialized hive materials:
  - **Iron → Carapace Plating**: Used for armored buildings and defensive upgrades
  - **Copper → Neural Conduits**: Powers advanced energy systems and control structures
  - **Coal → Enzymatic Catalyst**: Accelerates biological processes and evolution
  - **Oil → Organic Fluids**: Provides bio-fuel for more advanced evolution stages
  - **Uranium → Hyper-Evolutionary DNA**: Enables late-game mutations and superstructures
- This approach maintains familiar Factorio mining while integrating it into the hive theme
- Each resource has a specialized role in the evolution process
- Advanced structures require combinations of these specialized materials

### Creep System
- Starts with basic Factorio belts and inserters that show organic growths
- As biomass production increases, creep begins spreading naturally from structures
- Buildings must be placed on or near creep in later stages
- Creep spreads from certain structures (primarily the Hatchery)
- Creep provides the network for transporting biomass and resources between structures
- Creep absorbs pollution, converting it to a small amount of biomass
- Creep provides movement speed bonus to the player

### Biomass Economy
- Primary resource for hive structures is biomass
- Obtained by dissolving trees, biters, and other organic matter in pools
- Biomass is produced by:
  - Processing raw materials through extractors
  - Absorbing pollution via creep
  - Capturing and processing biters
- As biomass accumulates, mechanical buildings gradually mutate into fully organic versions
- Different specialized compounds are created by infusing biomass with traditional resources

### Genetic Data & Evolution
- Killing biters yields genetic data
- Genetic data is used to:
  - Unlock new hive structures
  - Upgrade existing structures
  - Research new biological technologies
- Evolution levels (1-5) determine what structures are available
- Higher evolution levels provide passive bonuses to all hive structures

### Infestation Progression
- **Phase 1**: Standard Factorio buildings with visible organic infestations
- **Phase 2**: Buildings begin fusing with biological components, increasing efficiency
- **Phase 3**: Fully organic hive structures replace mechanical buildings

### Infested Buildings Evolution

| Factorio Building | Stage 1: Infected Version | Stage 3: Fully Evolved |
|-------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Assembly Machine | Infested Assembler | Hatchery |
| Mining Drill | Infected Drill | Bio-Extractor |
| Lab | Mutated Lab | Evolution Chamber |
| Gun Turret | Infested Turret | Spine Crawler |
| Laser Turret | Organic Laser Turret | Spore Crawler |
| Transport Belt | Vein-Infested Belt | Creep Vein |
| Inserter | Tentacle-Infested Inserter | Tendril |
| Chest | Living Storage | Sac |
| Boiler/Steam Engine | Hybrid Reactor | Spawning Pool |
| Electric Pole | Organic Conduit | Creep Tumor |
| Roboport | Mutated Roboport | Transport Network |
| Rocket Silo | Infested Silo | Leviathan Chrysalis |

### Creep-Based Transport
- At first, the factory uses traditional belts and inserters, showing progressive infestation
- Over time, creep veins replace belts, allowing resources to flow organically
- Tendril inserters evolve to manipulate items from the creep instead of using mechanical arms
- Buildings slowly integrate with the creep, no longer requiring direct connections
- Resources flow through the creep rather than on belts
- Specialized structures can accelerate or direct flow within the creep
- Resources can be stored in biological sacs

### Pollution Mechanics
- Hive structures produce less pollution than their mechanical counterparts
- Creep absorbs pollution, converting it to small amounts of biomass
- High pollution still attracts biters, which is beneficial for genetic data collection
- Specialized structures can be evolved to process pollution more efficiently

### Power System Adaptation
- Initially uses standard Factorio power generators
- As evolution progresses, power is generated biologically through Bio-Reactors and Creep Conduits
- Neural Conduits (copper-infused biomass) form the basis of advanced energy networks
- The most advanced energy system is a Bio-Mechanical Fusion Reactor, merging organic and inorganic technology

### Space Age Integration
- Late-game evolution allows adaptation for space travel
- Specialized biological structures for surviving in space
- Leviathan Chrysalis serves as the rocket silo equivalent
- Space-adapted creep for colonizing other planets
- Hyper-Evolutionary DNA (uranium-infused biomass) enables space adaptation
